AI Fitness Trainer Web Application

AI Fitness Trainer is an intelligent fitness guidance web application designed to help users perform exercises correctly and safely using real time computer vision analysis. The application uses a camera feed to detect body posture, track movements, and provide instant feedback on exercise form, repetitions, and posture accuracy.

Built with a focus on simplicity and usability, the app allows users to train anywhere without the need for expensive gym equipment or personal trainers. The system analyzes key body landmarks, identifies incorrect form, and helps users improve performance while reducing the risk of injury.
